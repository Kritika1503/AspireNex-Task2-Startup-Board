This is a MERN stack website created using Chakra UI for frontend and designing the UI and Socket.io for real time chatting .This is a website where investors and start-ups founders can interact and ask for any help. It also contains a blog tab where general public can read about the happenings in the start-up eco system without signing in.
Preview of the Home Page:

Once the user signs in, the chat page will be seen where the list of people he/she interacts with is seen on the left. On right side the person he/she wants to chat with is visible on tapping the name of the user.The chat history is also displayed. The interface looks like:

Here on the top right corner we have an icon to view the user profile where the profile picture and email id is seen. We have a notification badge also on the top right corner which gives the count of number of unread messages of the user in real time using socket.io .The user can logout as well.

We also have an option to create a group chat where the number of users should be greater than 2 and people can chat in real time. We can also add/remove any one from the group and update the group name as well and leave the group (CRUD operation).

To integrate real-time chatting in the website I have used socket.io .It gives a typing icon if two user are interacting in real time and notification badge also gets updated if we have unread meassages.
